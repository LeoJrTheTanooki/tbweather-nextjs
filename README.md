#### Name Leo Garcia

#### Date: 3/31/2024
#### Description: A weather app built using Next.JS
#### Peer Reviewer: Zachary Dressel
#### Review Notes: As with most of Leo's projects, the design is highly stylized and what I would consider extremely well done. Responsiveness is extremely well done, everything looks and works good at every screen size. One immediate issue is that rather than have a geolocation that grabs my location and displays that data, it directs me initially to just Stockton. Another is that the forecast only has 4 days rather than the 5 that was requested as part of the original requirements of the project. Onto the code, its interesting to have an entire base value for the weather API return data at the top of the page function, and I cant figure out entirely what the purpose of it is. Past that, there is an empty function labelled "hourConvert". Other than that there are no visible issues and everything populates properly. Overall really well done, I enjoy the personalized aspects of the project, but there are a few issues that can be resolved to bring this to level-up.
